# Tripper
I made an app "Tripper" as a part of Mobile applications using C# course exercise. 

This app contains all the basic features.
- Creative UI design with carousel view.
- Proper navigation through all pages.
- Color cascading and font styling, custom images
- Local database called "SQL-Lite"
- Dynamic programming

About App:
Destination & hotel booking | Find Adventure Activities | Manage account.

Users can log in or sign up, search for the trip destination, and book trips, hotels & activities. Manage all bookings and make revisions & cancellations. 

It is not the final version, as the payment method, activities details, and map are not implemented yet. There will be another opportunity to work on that next semester in College.

Thanks!!
